The Moon and Sun Is about predicting sun and moon position, at observer’s sky. Algorithms are from “Astronomical Algorithms”. Track of sun in the sky, has been used in estimating amount solar energy received at any location.

Subroutine Moon_Day_Rise_Set gives rise and set time in local times. Moon rise and set happens when upper edge of apparent moon disk is touches horizon, that is when moon center is approximately 17 arc minutes or 0.26566 degree below horizon. MoonAngle is the elevation of moon center at rise and set. If user sets this angle to zero (0.0) degree, software will calculate half diameter of apparent moon. The software checks difference of moon elevation or altitude with precision of 0.0001degree.
