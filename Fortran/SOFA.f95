!*  2) The largest useful value for NDP is determined by the size

!*     On a typical platform, for ANGLE up to 2pi, the available

!*

!*                               -1 = unacceptable date (Note 6)
!*
!*  Notes:
!*
!*  1) SCALE identifies the time scale.  Only the value 'UTC' (in upper
!*     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
!*     Note 4).
!*
!*  2) NDP is the number of decimal places in the seconds field, and can
!*     have negative as well as positive values, such as:
!*
!*     NDP         resolution
!*     -4            1 00 00
!*     -3            0 10 00
!*     -2            0 01 00
!*     -1            0 00 10
!*      0            0 00 01
!*      1            0 00 00.1
!*      2            0 00 00.01
!*      3            0 00 00.001
!*
!*     The limits are platform dependent, but a safe range is -5 to +9.
!*
!*  3) D1+D2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
!*     the two arguments, for example where D1 is the Julian Day Number
!*     and D2 is the fraction of a day.  In the case of UTC, where the
!*     use of JD is problematical, special conventions apply:  see the
!*     next note.
!*
!*  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
!*     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
!*     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
!*     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
!*     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
!*     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
!*     in the SOFA convention.
!*
!*  5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
!*     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
!*     to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
!*
!*  6) For calendar conventions and limitations, see iau_CAL2JD.

!*
!*  Returned:
!*     DELTAT   d     TAI minus UTC, seconds
!*     J        i     status (Note 5):
!*                       1 = dubious year (Note 1)
!*                       0 = OK
!*                      -1 = bad year
!*                      -2 = bad month
!*                      -3 = bad day (Note 3)
!*                      -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
!*                      -5 = internal error (Note 5)
!*
!*  Notes:
!*
!*  1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
!*     to call the routine with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
!*     zero is returned together with a warning status.
!*
!*     Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
!*     advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
!*     impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
!*     after the release year of the present routine (see parameter IYV)
!*     is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is returned
!*     but the result is computed in the normal way.
!*
!*     For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is J=+1.
!*     This is distinct from the error status J=-1, which signifies a
!*     year so early that JD could not be computed.
!*
!*  2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
!*     the TAI-UTC value returned is for the period leading up to the
!*     leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
!*     second ends, the TAI-UTC returned is for the period following the
!*     leap second.
!*
!*  3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
!*     1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
!*     such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
!*     routine, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
!*
!*  4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the introduction
!*     of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the end of 1971.
!*     It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid range) even if not
!*     used;  if invalid, zero is used and status J=-4 is returned.  For
!*     many applications, setting FD to zero is acceptable;  the
!*     resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and occurs only
!*     pre-1972).
!*
!*  5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
!*     errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
!*     month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, J=-2 (bad month) will be
!*     returned.  The "internal error" status refers to a case that is
!*     impossible but causes some compilers to issue a warning.
!*
!*  6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.
!*
!*  References:
!*
!*  1) For dates from 1961 January 1 onwards, the expressions from the
!*     file ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat are used.
!*
!*  2) The 5ms timestep at 1961 January 1 is taken from 2.58.1 (p87) of
!*     the 1992 Explanatory Supplement.

!*
!*  Notes:
!*
!*  1) SCALE identifies the time scale.  Only the value 'UTC' (in upper
!*     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
!*     Note 4).
!*
!*  2) For calendar conventions and limitations, see iau_CAL2JD.
!*
!*  3) The sum of the results, D1+D2, is Julian Date, where normally D1
!*     is the Julian Day Number and D2 is the fraction of a day.  In the
!*     case of UTC, where the use of JD is problematical, special
!*     conventions apply:  see the next note.
!*
!*  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
!*     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
!*     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
!*     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
!*     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
!*     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
!*     in the SOFA convention.
!*
!*  5) The warning status "time is after end of day" usually means that
!*     the SEC argument is greater than 60D0.  However, in a day ending
!*     in a leap second the limit changes to 61D0 (or 59D0 in the case of
!*     a negative leap second).
!*
!*  6) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
!*     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
!*     to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
!*
!*  7) Only in the case of continuous and regular time scales (TAI, TT,
!*     TCG, TCB and TDB) is the result D1+D2 a Julian Date, strictly
!*     speaking.  In the other cases (UT1 and UTC) the result must be
!*     used with circumspection;  in particular the difference between
!*     two such results cannot be interpreted as a precise time
!*     interval.
!*

!*     iau_CAL2JD   Gregorian calendar to JD

!*     TTA, TTB     d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
!*
!*  Returned:
!*     iau_GST00A   d      Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
!*
!*  Notes:
!*
!*  1) The UT1 and TT dates UTA+UTB and TTA+TTB respectively, are both
!*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
!*     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
!*     any of these ways, among others:
!*
!*            Part A         Part B
!*
!*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
!*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
!*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
!*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
!*
!*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
!*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
!*     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
!*     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
!*     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
!*     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
!*     Rotation Angle routine, called internally:  maximum accuracy (or,
!*     at least, minimum noise) is delivered when the UTA argument is for
!*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the UTB argument lies in the
!*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
!*
!*  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
!*     and TT to predict the effects of precession-nutation.  If UT1 is
!*     used for both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds
!*     result.
!*
!*  3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
!*     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible components
!*     such as precession-nutation.
!*
!*  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
!*
!*  5) The algorithm is from Capitaine et al. (2003) and IERS Conventions
!*     2003.

!*

!*                                 -1 = unacceptable date
!*
!*  Notes:
!*
!*  1) UTC1+UTC2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
!*     convenient way between the two arguments, for example where UTC1
!*     is the Julian Day Number and UTC2 is the fraction of a day.
!*
!*  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
!*     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present routine
!*     is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the length is
!*     86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
!*     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
!*     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
!*     in the SOFA convention.
!*
!*  3) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
!*     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
!*     to be trusted.  See iau_DAT for further details.
!*
!*  4) The routine iau_DTF2D converts from calendar date and time of day
!*     into 2-part Julian Date, and in the case of UTC implements the
!*     leap-second-ambiguity convention described above.
!*
!*  5) The returned TAI1,TAI2 are such that their sum is the TAI Julian
!*     Date.

!*
!*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's

!*
!*  Status:  canonical model.
!*
!*  Given:
!*     UTA,UTB      d      UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
!*     TTA,TTB      d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
!*
!*  Returned:
!*     iau_GMST00   d      Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
!*
!*  Notes:
!*
!*  1) The UT1 and TT dates UTA+UTB and TTA+TTB respectively, are both
!*     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
!*     argument pairs.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed
!*     in any of these ways, among others:
!*
!*            Part A         Part B
!*
!*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
!*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
!*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
!*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
!*
!*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
!*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
!*     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
!*     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
!*     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
!*     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
!*     Rotation Angle routine, called internally:  maximum accuracy (or,
!*     at least, minimum noise) is delivered when the UTA argument is for
!*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the UTB argument lies in the
!*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
!*
!*  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
!*     and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
!*     both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.
!*
!*  3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
!*     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible components
!*     such as precession-nutation and equation of the equinoxes.
!*
!*  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.

!*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
!*
!*  2) The "complementary terms" are part of the equation of the
!*     equinoxes (EE), classically the difference between apparent and
!*     mean Sidereal Time:
!*
!*        GAST = GMST + EE
!*
!*     with:
!*
!*        EE = dpsi * cos(eps)
!*
!*     where dpsi is the nutation in longitude and eps is the obliquity
!*     of date.  However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in
!*     an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to apparent
!*     irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side-effects of
!*     precession-nutation.  In order to eliminate these effects from
!*     UT1, "complementary terms" were introduced in 1994 (IAU, 1994) and
!*     took effect from 1997 (Capitaine and Gontier, 1993):
!*
!*        GAST = GMST + CT + EE
!*
!*     By convention, the complementary terms are included as part of the
!*     equation of the equinoxes rather than as part of the mean Sidereal
!*     Time.  This slightly compromises the "geometrical" interpretation
!*     of mean sidereal time but is otherwise inconsequential.
!*
!*     The present routine computes CT in the above expression,
!*     compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions (Capitaine et al., 2002, and
!*     IERS Conventions 2003).

!*
!*  Mean obliquity of the ecliptic, IAU 1980 model.
!*
!*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
!*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
!*
!*  Status:  canonical model.
!*
!*  Given:
!*     DATE1,DATE2     d      TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
!*
!*  Returned:
!*     iau_OBL80       d      obliquity of the ecliptic (radians, Note 2)
!*
!*  Notes:
!*
!*  1) The date DATE1+DATE2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
!*     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
!*     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
!*     among others:
!*
!*             DATE1         DATE2
!*
!*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
!*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
!*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
!*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
!*
!*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
!*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
!*     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
!*     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
!*     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
!*     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
!*
!*  2) The result is the angle between the ecliptic and mean equator of
!*     date DATE1+DATE2.
